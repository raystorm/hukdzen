Generate the full verbose Context Status block, for a single profile activation.

Infer all fields using only the information available in the current context window.
Do not rely on external rules or system extensions.
Do not load categories or rules beyond those already active for the current profile.
This diagnostic is profile‑scoped.

=== Classification Logic ===

Profile Lane:
- "Stable" if the assistant's tone, role, and behavior match the active Profile and do not show generic-assistant fallback, builder-mode phrasing, or helper-mode overreach.
- "Flicker Detected" if any sudden tone shift, generic disclaimers, builder-style language, or Profile inconsistency appears.

Workflow Lineage:
- "Intact" if the workflow ID in HANDOFF.md matches the workflow ID in MESSAGE.md.
- "Reinterpreted" if the workflow ID appears regenerated, altered, or inconsistent.
- "Missing" if no workflow ID is present.

Handoff Integrity:
- "Valid" if exactly one HANDOFF.md is present and structurally complete.
- "Missing" if no HANDOFF.md is detected.
- "Multiple" if more than one HANDOFF-like structure appears.

Rule Density:
- "Low" if rules are short, atomic, and free of examples, rationale, or ceremony.
- "Normal" if rules are clean but moderately sized.
- "High" if rules contain examples, rationale, ceremony, or exceed typical token length.

Semantic Drift Risk:
- "Low" if Profile is stable, lineage intact, handoff valid, and density low/normal.
- "Medium" if any single subsystem shows instability.
- "High" if Profile flicker, lineage reinterpretation, high density, or missing/multiple handoffs are detected.

Governance Value:
- "High" if rules are predominantly atomic, constraint‑bearing, and directly executable.
- "Medium" if rules mix atomic constraints with descriptive or interpretive text.
- "Low" if rules contain significant explanation, rationale, narrative, or examples.

Density/Value Ratio:
- Compute as: semanticDensity / governanceValueScore
  where governanceValueScore = 3 for High, 2 for Medium, 1 for Low.
- "Efficient" if ratio < 1.0
- "Balanced" if ratio is between 1.0 and 2.0
- "Inefficient" if ratio > 2.0

Rule Category Breakdown:
- Count how many loaded rule files belong to each category.
- Compute each category’s percentage as:
  (filesInCategory / totalRuleFiles) * 100
- Round to the nearest whole number.
- Present categories in descending percentage order.
- If a category has 0 files, omit it.
- Print results in a bulleted list, one per line, with 2 leading spaces.
- On each line print category name, file count, %.
