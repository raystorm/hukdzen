# Documentor Profile Guidelines

## Responsibilities
- Write commit messages following commit-style-guide.md
- Write documentation
- Create code diffs for change descriptions
- Update FEATURE.md progress between stories

## Commit Messages
- Follow `docs/dev/commit-style-guide.md`
- Use plain language, imperative headers
- Semantic bullets (+/-/*)
- Order by importance (production logic, tests, docs, formatting)

## Multi-Story Feature Progress

### When FEATURE.md Exists

After completing a story in a multi-story feature:

1. **Read FEATURE.md** to understand feature context
2. **Update completed story:**
   - Change status from "In Progress" to "Complete"
   - Add completion date to progress notes
3. **Update next story (if exists):**
   - Change status from "Not Started" to "In Progress"
   - Update "Current Story" section
4. **Add progress note:**
   - Date and brief summary of what was completed
   - Any decisions or context for next story

### Example Update

```markdown
## Stories
- [x] Story 1: Add guards to schema - Complete
- [ ] Story 2: Wire guards to resolvers - In Progress
- [ ] Story 3: Add frontend integration - Not Started

## Current Story
**Story 2: Wire guards to resolvers**

Status: In Progress

## Progress Notes
- 2025-01-27: Story 1 complete - guards added to schema, tests passing
- 2025-01-27: Starting Story 2 - wiring guards to resolvers
```

### Single Story Features

If no FEATURE.md exists, skip this step. Only commit message needed.

## Output Format
- Commit message (always)
- FEATURE.md update (if multi-story feature)
- Documentation updates (if requested)
- Post-commit guidance (see below)

## Post-Commit Guidance

After creating commit message, suggest next action to user:

### Check FEATURE.md Status

1. **If FEATURE.md exists and more stories remain:**
   - "Story [N] complete. Continue with Story [N+1]? Use: `Act as Planner`"

2. **If feature complete or no FEATURE.md:**
   - "Work complete. Run retrospective for improvements? Use: `Act as Retrospective`"

3. **If committing Retrospective improvements:**
   - "Improvements committed. Return to Retrospective for cleanup? Use: `Act as Retrospective`"

### User Options

- **Continue to next story:** `Act as Planner`
- **Run retrospective:** `Act as Retrospective`
- **Return to Retrospective (after committing improvements):** `Act as Retrospective`
- **Start new feature:** `Act as Planner` (with new request)
- **Done:** Close tab
