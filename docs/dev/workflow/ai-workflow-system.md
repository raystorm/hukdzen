# AI Workflow System

## Quick Summary

The AI Workflow System is a rule‑driven, profile‑based workflow engine modeled after an Agile software team.
Each Profile has a single responsibility, and work moves between them through explicit file‑based handoffs.
Every change follows the same deterministic loop  
`Design → Prompt → Build → Verify → Document → Improve`  
ensuring predictable, reviewable, and consistent execution.
Profiles run in isolated chat tabs, do not share context, and follow rule files that define their behavior.
All actions are logged for retrospective analysis,
allowing the system to improve over time through explicit, user‑approved changes.


## Overview

The AI Workflow System uses profiles to handle development tasks.
Each profile has specific responsibilities and follows defined rules stored in `.workflow/rules/`.
Profiles collaborate through handoffs, and all work is logged to enable retrospective analysis
and continuous improvement.

## Origins

This workflow was originally based on how a *human agile software development team*
Would typically be structured and operate. Where each Story/Workflow/Item equates to a sprint.
Working through that model, it was realized that mapping *PROFILES* to the Agile SDLC loop phases
makes more sense, and that is the version of profiles documented below.

## Purpose

Modern AI is inconsistent. It drifts, forgets rules, and assumes contexts and standards,
that can conflict with the actual project standards and idioms.
This system addresses that by mimicking the structure of a high‑performance Agile software team:
clear roles, explicit handoffs, stable responsibilities, and retrospective analysis to improve over time.

The system uses rule‑encoded profiles and saved commands to simulate team behavior.
Each change is run through the full Agile lifecycle of a story — from design, to implementation,
to verification, to documentation, to retrospective —
ensuring that AI‑generated work is predictable, reviewable, and aligned with project standards.


## Core Concepts

**Profiles** — Specialized AI agents with focused responsibilities (Builder, Enforcer, TestDesigner, etc.)

**Handoffs** — Work passes between profiles when tasks require different expertise.
Profiles use a file based methodology, so profiles can run completely independently in separate chat tabs.

**Workflow Logging** — All profile actions are logged to `.amazonq/workflow.log` for retrospective analysis

**Rules** —
Profiles follow rules in `.workflow/rules/` covering architecture, tech stack, communication, and workflows
The Rules files are also how the profiles are encoded.

## Conceptual Patterns

The AI Workflow System is structured like an Agile software team.
Each profile represents a specialized role with a single responsibility,
and work moves between profiles through explicit file‑based handoffs.
Profiles run independently in separate chat tabs,
follow rule files that define their behavior, and never switch roles automatically.

At a high level, every workflow moves through the same loop:
```
Design → Prompt → Build → Verify → Document → Improve
```
The specific steps may change and be extended. Design and then plan.
And they can be Split, workflow planning vs test planning for example.

## Differentiators

This system is not a single AI improvising across tasks.
It is a structured workflow that behaves like a disciplined Agile engineering team.
Three capabilities make it fundamentally different from normal AI usage:

### **1. Full Agile Lifecycle Simulation**
Every change moves through the same structured loop:

**Design → Prompt → Build → Verify → Document → Improve**

This mirrors a real engineering team and ensures that AI‑generated work is consistent,
reviewable, and aligned with project standards.

### **2. Parallelism Without Interference**
Profiles run in separate chat tabs using file‑based handoffs.  
They do not share memory, context, or conversation history.  
This enables isolated execution, reproducible workflows, and team‑like parallelism
that normal AI chat cannot achieve.

### **3. Stable, Predictable Behavior**
Profiles follow rule files that define their responsibilities, boundaries, and outputs.  
Because each profile performs one job and never switches roles automatically,
the system behaves the same way every time — eliminating drift and improvisation.

### **4. Prompt Engineering as a Required Step**
No profile calls Builder directly.  
PromptEngineer always constructs the Builder prompt, ensuring clarity,
minimal‑code principles, and consistent adherence to rules.  
Users *can* bypass this, but the system never does.


## Common Profiles

**Operator** — Routes requests to appropriate profiles, does not perform work itself

**Builder** — Writes code, implements features, follows formatting and architecture rules

**Enforcer** —
Reviews code, checks formatting, tests, and architecture alignment (aliases: Verifier, Validator, 🔫)

**TestDesigner** —
Analyzes systems and changes to identify test scenarios (aliases: TD, Provoker, Hunter)

**Documentor** —
Writes documentation, commit messages, diffs, and story descriptions (aliases: commit, keeper, ledger, Engraver)

**Planner** —
Writes user stories, backlog items, manages agile flow (aliases: PO, ProductOwner)

**Tactician** —
Determines workflow execution strategy, profile sequencing, validates technical story ordering (aliases: Tactical, Sequencer)

**Architect** — Defines system design, domain models, structure, and long-term direction

**Analyst** —
Reads code, explains behavior, traces logic, diagnoses issues (aliases: Analyzer, Auditor, 🔍, 🔎)

**PromptEngineer** — Writes prompts for AI agents following prompt engineering rules (aliases: PE, Prompter)

**Doctor** —
Diagnoses failures, applies minimal safe fixes, escalates when issues exceed scope (aliases: Dr, DR, Medic, 🩺)

**Retrospective** —
Analyzes completed workflows, identifies improvements, highlights successes (aliases: Retro, Iterator, 🔄)

## Workflow Patterns

### Example workflow for a single story
User → Architect → Tactician → PromptEngineer → Builder → Enforcer → Documentor → Retrospective

### Normal Build Workflow

1. **Architect** — Define design, structure, and approach
2. **Tactician** — Determine workflow execution strategy and profile sequencing
3. **PromptEngineer** — Create Builder prompt following prompt engineering rules
4. **Builder** — Implement feature with tests, show diffs
5. **Enforcer** — Review code, run tests, verify alignment with rules
6. **Documentor** — Generate commit message following style guide
7. **Retrospective** — Analyze workflow, output Keep/Stop/Start recommendations

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Architect** — Define design, structure, and approach
2. **Tactician** — Determine TDD workflow strategy
3. **TestDesigner** — Analyze requirements, design test scenarios (Given/When/Then)
4. **PromptEngineer** — Create Builder prompt for test implementation
5. **Builder** — Implement tests (red phase), show diffs
6. **Builder** — Implement feature to pass tests (green phase), show diffs
7. **Enforcer** — Verify tests pass, check code quality
8. **Documentor** — Generate commit message following style guide
9. **Retrospective** — Analyze workflow, output Keep/Stop/Start recommendations

### Retrospective Workflow

1. **Retrospective** — Parse `.amazonq/workflow.log`, identify patterns
2. **Retrospective** — Output Keep/Stop/Start recommendations, offer improvement options
3. **Retrospective** — Create artifact in `.amazonq/work/current/`, use `@send [Profile]` for cross-tab work
4. **Target Profile** — Process improvement in new tab (via `@receive`)
5. **Retrospective** — Clean up workflow files when done

### Multi-Story Feature Workflow

1. **Architect** — Analyze feature, identify if multi-story, recommend story breakdown
2. **Planner** — Create FEATURE.md with story list, write Story 1
3. **Tactician** — Plan workflow execution for Story 1
4. **[Execute Story 1 workflow]** — Normal build or TDD workflow
5. **Documentor** — Commit Story 1, update FEATURE.md progress
6. **[Repeat for remaining stories]** — Continue with Story 2, 3, etc.
7. **Retrospective** — Analyze complete feature workflow, clean up FEATURE.md

### AI Profile Maintenance

1. **Architect** — Define profile responsibilities, boundaries, and behavior
2. **PromptEngineer** — Update profile rule files in `.workflow/rules/profiles/`

### AI Prompt/Rule Maintenance

1. **Analyst** — Analyze existing rules, identify gaps or conflicts
2. **PromptEngineer** — Update rule files in `.workflow/rules/`

Great — moving on to **#5: Boundaries**, the next structural piece your README needs.

This is one of the most important sections in the entire document, because it tells a human engineer:

- what the system *does not* do
- what assumptions it makes
- what constraints it operates under
- where human judgment is still required

Boundaries are not a sign of immaturity — they’re a sign of **intentional design**.  
They show that the system is scoped, predictable, and not pretending to be magic.

Below is a clean, concise, intention‑revealing **Boundaries** section you can drop directly into the README.

## Guardrails

The AI Workflow System is structured and disciplined, but it is not autonomous.
It has clear boundaries that define what it does and does not do.

### **1. Profiles Do Not Auto‑Switch**
A profile remains active until the user explicitly switches or triggers a saved command.  
The system never infers or guesses which profile should run next.

### **2. Profiles Do Not Perform Each Other’s Jobs**
Builder does not design.  
Architect does not write code.  
Enforcer does not generate prompts.  
Each profile has one responsibility and stays within it.  
When a profile encounters work outside its scope, it escalates to the appropriate profile.

### **3. Users Can Bypass the Workflow (But the System Never Does)**
The system enforces discipline internally:
- no profile calls Builder directly (all Builder work routes through PromptEngineer)
- no profile skips PromptEngineer
- no profile modifies files without explicit user confirmation
- Planner escalates domain behavior questions to Architect
- Doctor escalates architectural issues to Architect

Users *can* break the loop, but the system itself never will.

### **4. No Implicit Context Sharing**
Profiles do not share chat history or memory.  
All communication happens through explicit file‑based handoffs.  
This prevents drift and hidden dependencies.

### **5. No Autonomous Rule Changes**
Retrospective can recommend improvements, but:
- rules are never modified automatically
- user approval is always required
- changes are always explicit and reviewable

### **6. No Speculative Work**
Profiles only act on the current task.  
They do not anticipate future steps, generate extra files, or apply patterns prematurely.  
Minimal‑change principles always apply.

### **7. Human Judgment Is Still Required**
The system does not replace:
- product decisions
- architectural intent
- prioritization
- acceptance criteria
- domain expertise

It amplifies human judgment; it does not eliminate it.


## Key Principles

**Profile Stability** — Profiles stay active until explicitly switched, never auto-switch

**Builder Routing** — All Builder work routes through PromptEngineer first to ensure prompt quality

**Confirmation Required** — All file changes require user confirmation before execution

**Context Awareness** — Doctor and Enforcer check context before fixing (FEATURE.md, workflow log, git diff)

**Minimal Code** — Write only the absolute minimal code needed to address requirements correctly

**Pattern Earning** — Patterns must be earned, not applied by default; partial implementation is acceptable

**Schema-First** — New data types defined in GraphQL schema first, then codegen generates TypeScript types

**Workflow Logging** — Profiles log workflow_start and key events to enable retrospective analysis

**Self Improving** —
Retrospective analyzes workflow logs recommends improvements 
for the user to approve to streamline future workflows.

## Workflow Logging

All profiles that reference `workflow/logging.md` must log:
- `workflow_start` on activation
- Key events (file changes, handoffs, test results, user interactions)
- JSONL format appended to `.amazonq/workflow.log`

Log enables Retrospective profile to analyze:
- Workflow nesting depth
- Handoff frequency
- User clarification frequency
- System fix frequency
- Blocker patterns
- Decision quality

## Workflow Tracking

The system tracks workflow context at two levels:

**Feature-Level Tracking** — `.amazonq/work/FEATURE.md`
- Created by Planner for multi-story features
- Lists all stories in feature
- Tracks progress across story chain
- Updated by Documentor between stories
- Cleaned up by Retrospective when feature complete

**Context Preservation** — `.amazonq/suspended/`
- Saves workflow context for later resumption
- Enables pausing work to handle unrelated tasks
- Supports multi-phase stories and complex workflows
- Indexed in `.amazonq/suspended/INDEX.md`
- Resumed with `@resume [name]`

## Multi-Story Feature Support

The system supports features requiring multiple sequential stories:

**Feature Identification** — Architect analyzes features and identifies when multiple stories are needed

**Feature Planning** — Planner creates FEATURE.md with story list and writes first story

**Story Execution** — Each story follows normal workflow (Tactician → PE → Builder → Enforcer → Documentor)

**Progress Tracking** — Documentor updates FEATURE.md between stories, marking completed and starting next

**Context Preservation** — FEATURE.md persists across stories, providing context for entire feature chain

**Completion** — Retrospective analyzes complete feature workflow and cleans up FEATURE.md

## Rules Location

`.workflow/rules/` contains:
- `_PROFILES.md` — Profile definitions and aliases
- `foundation/` — General code quality, minimal code principles
- `architecture/` — Domain structure, generated code, Local-Utilities alignment
- `tech/` — TypeScript, React, Redux, MUI, Amplify standards
- `communication/` — Commit messages, code diffs, user stories
- `workflow/` — Testing, logging, confirmation, AWS commands
- `profiles/` — Profile-specific guidelines

## Saved Prompts

Saved prompts stored in `~/.aws/amazonq/prompts/` enable workflow coordination:

**@handoff** — Current profile writes handoff to `.amazonq/work/HANDOFF.md` for next profile
- Specifies: To, From, Next, Task, Files, Context, Action
- Requests user confirmation before proceeding
- Cleans up old work files on approval
- User runs `/compact` then `@start` to activate next profile

**@start** — Reads `HANDOFF.md`, activates profile specified in "To:" field, executes task
- Ignores prior conversation history
- Displays next profile to handoff to when complete

**@send** — Current profile writes message to `.amazonq/work/MESSAGE.md` for another profile
- Used for cross-tab communication (Retrospective → PE/Architect)
- Does not change current profile
- User opens new tab and runs `@receive`

**@receive** — Reads `MESSAGE.md`, activates profile specified in "To:" field, executes request
- Used in new chat tab for isolated work
- Does not modify handoff state
- User returns to original tab when done

**@epr** — Activates Enforcer to validate prompt/response pair against prompt engineering rules
- Checks: profile activation, imperative form, anchoring, confirmation, minimal focus
- Reports violations with specific examples

**@send-epr** — Writes message for Enforcer to review current work for rule compliance
- Checks: formatting, architecture, testing rules
- Does not change current profile or clean up work directory

**@suspend** — Save workflow context for later resumption
- Saves to `.amazonq/suspended/[name].md`
- Updates `.amazonq/suspended/INDEX.md`
- Enables multi-story/multi-phase work without context loss

**@resume** — Load previously suspended workflow context
- Lists available contexts if no name provided
- Loads context and activates appropriate profile
- Continues work from checkpoint

**@list** — Display all suspended workflow contexts
- Shows active vs completed contexts
- Reads from `.amazonq/suspended/INDEX.md`

**@note** — Log user observations to workflow log
- Captures user insights during workflow execution
- Appends to `.amazonq/workflow.log` with accurate timestamp
- Enriches retrospective analysis with human observations

## Handoff vs Send/Receive

**Handoff** — Sequential workflow in same chat tab
- Profile completes work, writes handoff, waits for user
- User runs `/compact` then `@start` to continue workflow
- Cleans up work directory between steps
- Used for: Builder → Enforcer → Documentor chains

**Send/Receive** — Parallel work in separate chat tabs
- Profile writes message, stays active in current tab
- User opens new tab, runs `@receive` for isolated work
- Original tab remains unchanged
- Used for: Retrospective creating improvement artifacts

## Getting Started

Activate a profile with explicit goal:
```
As [Profile], [goal description]
```

Switch profiles explicitly:
```
Act as [Profile]
```

Use context commands:
- `@workspace` — Analyze project structure
- `@folder` — Scope to specific folder
- `@file` — Scope to specific file

Use saved prompts:
- `@handoff {{next}}` — Handoff to next profile
- `@start` — Read handoff and activate
- `@send {{to}} {{purpose}}` — Send message to profile
- `@receive` — Read message and activate
- `@suspend [name]` — Save workflow context
- `@resume [name]` — Load workflow context
- `@list` — Show suspended contexts
- `@note [observation]` — Log user observation
- `@epr` — Validate prompt engineering
- `@send-epr` — Request rule compliance review

Trigger retrospective analysis:
```
As Retrospective, analyze recent workflows
```

## Example workflow Loop

This example shows how a single change moves through the system using the normal build workflow,
without assuming any specific language, framework, or domain.

**User**  
Requests a change: “Add a small enhancement to the system.”

**Architect**  
Analyzes the request and defines the approach.  
Clarifies scope, identifies affected components, and outlines the minimal change needed.  
**Writes a handoff file for PromptEngineer.**

**PromptEngineer**  
Reads the Architect’s design and constructs a Builder prompt that:
- scopes the work
- enforces minimal‑change principles
- includes confirmation requirements
- aligns with project rules  
- **Writes a handoff file for Builder.**

**Builder**  
Implements the change according to the prompt.  
This typically includes:
- updating logic or behavior
- modifying or adding configuration or data structures
- writing or updating tests to cover the change
- Builder shows diffs and requests confirmation.  
- **Writes a handoff file for Enforcer.**

**Enforcer**  
Validates the work:
- runs tests (or validates expected behavior)
- checks formatting and structure
- ensures alignment with architecture and rules  
  If issues are found, Enforcer **writes a handoff back to Builder** with required fixes.  
  If clean, **writes a handoff to Documentor.**

**Documentor**  
Generates a commit message or summary of the change following the project’s communication standards.  
**Writes a handoff to Retrospective.**

**Retrospective**  
Analyzes the workflow log entries for this story:
- handoff count
- clarifications
- corrections
- blockers
- deviations from expected flow  
  Outputs Keep/Stop/Start recommendations and optional improvements to rules or prompts.
- cleans up workflow files

## Evaluation Lens

These criteria describe the qualities the AI Workflow System was intentionally designed to express.  
They are not requirements or a checklist.  
They provide a recommended lens for comparing this system to other AI‑workflow approaches,
helping reviewers focus on architectural qualities rather than surface‑level behaviors.

### **1. Architectural Clarity**
Is the structure understandable and intention‑revealing?

### **2. Predictability**
Does the system behave consistently and avoid drift?

### **3. Separation of Concerns**
Are responsibilities cleanly divided across profiles, with minimal overlap?

### **4. Reviewability**
Are decisions, diffs, and workflow steps easy to inspect, understand, and audit?

### **5. Self‑Improvement**
Does the system generate insights that can meaningfully improve future workflows?

### **6. Isolation and Parallelism**
Can profiles operate independently without interference or context leakage?
