# Commit Message Standards

## Critical Rule
- ALWAYS follow the commit style guide in `docs/dev/commit-style-guide.md`
- Use plain language, imperative headers, and semantic bullets
- Order bullets by importance (production logic, tests, docs, formatting)
- Group related changes conceptually
- Wrap file names and code objects in backticks
- Use domain vocabulary consistently
- All commit messages MUST be concise and distilled

## Bullet System
- `+` Added
- `*` Changed/Updated/Improved
- `-` Removed

## Bullet Semantic Integrity
- `+` bullets MUST use additive language (added, new, created, introduced)
- `-` bullets MUST use subtractive language (removed, deleted, dropped)
- `*` bullets for changes that aren't pure additions or removals

## Examples

### Verbose vs Concise

**❌ Too verbose (lists implementation details):**
```
  + added Return Type Specification to TestDesigner Output Format
    * conditional guidance: only when scenario depends on structure
    * Gherkin example format with property paths
```

**✅ Concise (distills to essential change):**
```
  + added return type specification to TestDesigner (conditional on scenario needs)
```

### Semantic Bullet Integrity

**`+` bullets MUST use additive language:**

**❌ Wrong (not additive):**
```
  + TestDesigner specifies return type structure when scenario depends on it
```

**✅ Correct (additive language):**
```
  + added return type specification to TestDesigner (conditional on scenario needs)
```

**Additive language:**
- ✅ added, new, created, introduced
- ❌ specifies, validates, checks (not additive)

**`-` bullets MUST use subtractive language:**

**❌ Wrong (not subtractive):**
```
  - validation no longer checks for empty fields
```

**✅ Correct (subtractive language):**
```
  - removed empty field validation
```

**Subtractive language:**
- ✅ removed, deleted, dropped
- ❌ no longer uses, stops checking (not subtractive)

**`*` bullets for changes:**
- ✅ changed, updated, improved, modified
- ❌ added (use `+` instead), removed (use `-` instead)

## Renames
- Use arrow syntax (`->`) for renames in summary line and bullets
- Example summary: `oldName -> newName for consistency`
- Example bullet: `* AlertMessage -> AlertView`

## Handoff Context vs Commit Style
- Handoffs may contain detailed implementation notes for context
- Documentor must distill handoff details into concise commit format
- Group enumerated items conceptually (don't list all 8 actions, say "added Success/Failure actions")
- Ignore implementation details that don't belong in commit history (like specific helper function names)
- Focus on what changed and why, not how it was implemented

## Example Formats

### Single‑Line Example
```
Add Placeholder to `update-me.md`
```

### Multi-Line Example
```
Commit message with multiple changes

+ add `new-file.md` with placeholder content
- removed  placeholder for demonstration
* formatting
```

### Complex Nested Example
```
WIP - Example Commit to demonstrate complex formatting (NOT A REAL COMMIT)

  + add `example-file.md` — used in this commit example to show objects
    Natural line break for a second line of info
    * `example-file2.md` was affected by this update
    * `example-file3.md` Section Name -> Other Name for clarity
      - removed Remove Me section, because it was no longer needed
    * supporting detail
  + add `new-file.md` with some exciting features
  + WIP - This change is still in progress
  + add sample bullet to this commit
    * supporting sub Bullet 1
    * supporting sub Bullet 2
    + add sub bullet 3
  * formatting
    - removed some uneccessary `---` seperators
  - removed specific thing, and why
    * supporting info
    - something else that was removed with it.
    + something that had to be added because of the removal
